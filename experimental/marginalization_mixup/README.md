# Combining Ensembles and Data Augmentation Can Harm Your Calibration

This directory contains the original scripts used for the paper's benchmark
results, as well as experiments analyzing the compounding underconfidence of
ensembles and data augmentation.

NOTE: An updated version of the codebase, further expanding on the original
results, can be found in
[Uncertainty Baselines](https://github.com/google/uncertainty-baselines).
